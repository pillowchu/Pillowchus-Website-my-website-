<h1>John Pork</h1>
<p>Before Fame:<br><br></p>

Before fame John Mathew Pig (john pork) was a kind guy, living in a castle minding his business. Working at a butchers.
He loved to party and fuck gals. <br>After he broke up with his now ex (Jessica pig) she decided to spread some nude
images of john, ruining his reputation. He has to quit his job and become homeless.

<br><br>
<p>His solution to make money<br></p>

He decided to try the youtube. Going under the alias of what we now know as John Pork. He succeeded in life. Gaining
millions of followers, overpassing t-series.

<br><br>
<p>The Downfall of John Pork<br></p>

In the year 2018, John pork was known as a star. A big thing that contributed to this is that his face was used as the
leading role of 'TechnoBlades face reveal' before his passing. He was a meme and he couldn't help but feel sad inside.
<br>In 2023, he decided to try and make his depression stop by calling people, this became even more of a meme and went
viral on tiktok, showing templates of `John Pork is calling` and was segregated from real life.<br> This viral meme was
created by roverjoe. He has now took down the video due to later refrences.<br><br>

This made john even more sad as no one picked up. There could have been multiple reasons for this; one of them being
that he used an insufferable ringtone, causing people just to mute there phones. Or maybe because he was a pig and was
looked at different in society. Nobody really knows.

<p>The Death of John Pork<br></p>

On the 30th March 2023, it was revealed to the internet that john pork has commited suicide due to no one picking up.<br>
This made people feel guilty inside and picked up any phone calls they received . Even former president obama had<br>
something to say about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Km6_voIkvU. This was taken very serious. People couldnt<br>
believe he did a thing. They searched to find his body.<br><br>

<p>What they found><br></p>

The public was right, john pork wasnt dead, he faked his own death to see if the world cared. And when they found him he
was armed and dangerous.

<p>The victims<br></p>
<p>Victim 1:</p>
People found him eating out a rats body. We later found out that it was Biggy Cheese, an upcoming rapper. <br>He loved his
family. He died from answering a call from John pork as he heard the news of his death and was startled to see this.<br>
John pork then got his ip adresss, then his actual address. He hunted him down and eat his remains. <br> He is now on FBI's
most wanted list.
<br><br>
This lasted for 3 days until he was in custody. Detained by officers after 12 hours in Cleveland Ohio. In this time, he
was able to kill 31 unnamed cases and one named case of the hostage Steve Beef. A fellow friend of John. The only way he
was able to last this long was due to his military experience in Afghanistan. Without this the fbi would have caught him
earlier.

<br><br> <p>The end for now...<br><br></p>

Respects are now being paided to the victims familys who answered his calls. <br> He is serving the death penalty with his
partner in crime Marvin Beek. A fellow trump supporter and a activist for womens rights to be removed. <br> He killed a total
of 10 people for **not** picking up johns calls.<br>
